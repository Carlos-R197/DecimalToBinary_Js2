# Base 10 to base 2 conversion in Javascript

This program can convert positive decimal numbers in their binary value.

In order to run it first clone or download the repository. Once you have the repository run the command
"npm install --save-dev jest" to install the test framework. With the test framework in your hands you can use the command
"npm test" to see the result of the tests.

If you don't have npm in your computer you can get it through Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
